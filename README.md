# **Get Strong**

Get Strong is a training companion designed to assist you in creating, 
logging and reviewing your training regime.  
For years, I have been searching for a web app that allows me easily create a workout, 
review my progress and most importantly, 
log my workout easily while working out.  
I never found it!  
So, I will create it here.

## **Goal for this project**

To create an easy to use workout logging app which allows the creation of personalised workouts.
Users will be able to review their progress over time and customise their workouts to fit their own objectives.
